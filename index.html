        <p>Hello! I'm AMANI Daniel and I'm from Rwanda-Kigali. I enjoy coding and I like to use
            programming languages as tools to solve real world problem. I also like to read th Holy
            Bible because it helps me to build strong covenant with God. I was blessed to study in
            BYU-pathway world-wide. It helped me to gain more knowledges, skills and attitudes that
            are required to solve the real world problems. BYU-pathway world-wide also helps me to
            get closer to God because it gives me chance to pray and read the scriptures together
            with others in the
            gathering. This strengthens me because it give us chance to share our testimonies with
            others. I appreciate the opportunities that I get through BYU-pathway world-wide, and I
            will use them to bless other who are struggling as I were blessed. </p>
